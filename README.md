            <h2 class="adventure">Adventure Time</h2>
            <p class="text">Adventurous experiences create psychological arousal, which can be interpreted as negative
                or positive .For some people, adventure becomes a major pursuit in and of itself. According to
                adventurer André Malraux, in his Man's Fate, If a man is not ready to risk his life, where is his
                dignity?.Similarly, Helen Keller stated that "Life is either a daring adventure or nothing."
            <br> <br>
            Outdoor adventurous activities are typically undertaken for the purposes of recreation or
                excitement:examples are adventure racing and adventure tourism. Adventurous activities can also lead to
                gains in knowledge, such as those undertaken by explorers and pioneers the British adventurer Jason
                Lewis, forexample, uses adventures to draw global sustainability lessons from living within finite
                environmental constraints on expeditions to share with schoolchildren. Adventure education intentionally
                uses challenging experiences for learning</p>

                <h2 class="description">BIKING</h2>
            </div>
            <p class="text">Mountain biking is a sport of riding bicycles off-road, often over rough terrain,
                usually using
                specially designed mountain bikes. Mountain bikes share similarities with other bikes but
                incorporate features designed to enhance durability and performance in rough terrain, such as air or
                coil-sprung shocks used as suspension, larger and wider wheels and tires, stronger frame materials,
                and mechanically or hydraulically actuated disc brakes. Mountain biking can generally be broken down
                into five distinct categories: cross country, trail riding, all mountain (also referred to as
                "Enduro"), downhill, and freeride.
            <br> <br>
            This sport requires endurance, core strength and balance, bike handling skills, and
            self-reliance.
            Advanced riders pursue both steep technical descents and high incline climbs. In the case of
            freeride, downhill, and dirt jumping, aerial maneuvers are performed off both natural features and
            specially constructed jumps and ramps.</p>

                <h2 class="description">PARAGLIDING</h2>
            </div>
            <p class="text">Paragliding is the recreational and competitive adventure sport of flying paragliders:
                lightweight,
                free-flying, foot-launched glider aircraft with no rigid primary structure. The pilot sits in a
                harness or lies supine in a cocoon-like 'pod' suspended below a fabric wing. Wing shape is
                maintained by the suspension lines, the pressure of air entering vents in the front of the wing, and
                the aerodynamic forces of the air flowing over the outside.

            <br> <br>
            Despite not using an engine, paraglider flights can last many hours and cover many
            hundreds of
            kilometres, though flights of one to two hours and covering some tens of kilometres are more the
            norm. By skillful exploitation of sources of lift, the pilot may gain height, often climbing to
            altitudes of a few thousand metres.</p>

                <h2 class="description">SURFING</h2>
            </div>
            <p class="text">Surfing is a surface water sport in which an individual, a surfer (or two
                in tandem surfing), uses a
                board to ride on the forward section, or face, of a moving wave of water, which usually carries the
                surfer towards the shore. Waves suitable for surfing are primarily found on ocean shores, but can
                also be found in standing waves in the open ocean, in lakes, in rivers in the form of a tidal bore,
                or in wave pools.
            <br><br>
            The term surfing refers to a person riding a wave using a board, regardless
            of the stance. There are
            several types of boards. The Moche of Peru would often surf on reed craft, while the native peoples
            of the Pacific surfed waves on alaia, paipo, and other such water craft. Ancient cultures often
            surfed on their belly and knees, while the modern-day definition of surfing most often refers to a
            surfer riding a wave standing on a surfboard; this is also referred to as stand-up surfing.</p>
